# 🚀 Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio  

Welcome to my **Data Science Portfolio**, where I showcase projects covering machine learning, AI, and predictive analytics.  

## 📂 Projects Overview  

### 1️⃣ Deepfake Detection (Computer Vision)  
- Built and compared **ResNet-50, ConvNeXt, and EfficientNet** for detecting AI-generated deepfake images.  
- Applied **Grad-CAM** for model interpretability.  
- **[Project Details](Deepfake-Detection/README.md)**  

### 2️⃣ Telecommunication Churn Prediction  
- Developed **ML models (Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, SVMs)** to predict customer churn.  
- Addressed class imbalance using **SMOTE & Tomek Links**.  
- **[Project Details](Machine-Learning-Churn-Prediction/README.md)**  

### 3️⃣ Mental Health & CGPA Analysis  
- Analyzed the impact of **stress, anxiety, and depression** on students' academic performance.  
- Used **OLS regression** to study demographic factors affecting mental health.  
- **[Project Details](Data-Science-Mental-Health-CGPA-Analysis/README.md)**  

### 4️⃣ Support Vector Machine (SVM) Implementation  
- Explained **SVM theory, convex optimization, and kernel methods**.  
- Implemented an **SVM classifier from scratch** using `cvxopt` and visualized decision boundaries.  
- **[Project Details](SVM-Implementation/README.md)**
